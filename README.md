# CS255 – System Analysis and Design Portfolio  

## DriverPass Project Reflection  

**1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project.**  
The client for this project was DriverPass, a company that wanted a system to help students prepare for their driving exams. They needed a platform that included online practice tests, driving lesson scheduling, progress tracking, and reporting for both students and instructors.  

**2. What did you do particularly well?**  
I did well identifying the user’s needs and turning them into clear requirements. My documents were organized in a way that both technical and non-technical audiences could understand.  

**3. If you could revise one part of your work, what would you improve?**  
I would improve the performance requirements by being more specific. Instead of saying “within seconds,” I would state that pages should load in **2 seconds or less**. I would also reference the client’s user interface sketch to better connect my design to their vision.  

**4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is this important?**  
I reviewed the requirements and made sure features like registration, practice tests, scheduling, and reporting were part of the system design. Considering user needs is important because the system must solve their problems and make their experience smoother, not more complicated.  

**5. How do you approach designing software, and what strategies would you use in the future?**  
I approach software design step by step: gather requirements, create models (process and object), and refine the design with feedback. In the future, I would add prototyping and user stories to better capture real-world use and ensure the design matches what users expect.
